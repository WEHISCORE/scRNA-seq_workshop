- Motivation
  - Visualization
    - Library size
    - Composition biases
    - Sparsity
  - Size factors
- Library size normalization
  - Simple to explain but not the best
- Normalization by deconvolution
  - Conceptually similar to library size normalization but better behaved
- Applying size factors
  - Scaling and log-transforming
  - Downsampling and log-transforming
    - Skip?
- Advanced / boutique normalization
  - Normalization by spike-in
  - Gene-specific normalization factors / variance stabilizing transformations
- Recommendation
  - Deconvolution normalization is good default
    - Cite benchmark studies
