  - Fig. 2 of Song, F., Chan, G. M. & Wei, Y. Flexible Experimental Designs for Valid Single-cell RNA-sequencing Experiments Allowing Batch Effects Correction. bioRxiv 533372 (2019) doi:10.1101/533372 has some examples of good / bad experimental design
- Obtaining a count matrix
- Data processing and downstream analysis
  - Illustrate with quick start example? Or perhaps put this in the recap?
  - Be wary of pseudoalignment methods for snRNA-seq because the default reference won't contain unspliced transcripts (could use a modified index, cf. kalisto + BUStools RNA velocity method)
