# Overview

This 2-day workshop will provide a solid foundation in the usage of Bioconductor software tools for single-cell RNA-seq analysis.
Bioconductor is an open source, open development software project to provide tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. It is based primarily on the R programming language. 
The workshop is based on the free e-book, ‘Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor’, and the analysis strategies used by WEHI’s Single Cell Open Research Endeavour (SCORE). 

# Who should attend?

- Interested experimental biologists.
- Seasoned bioinformaticians who are looking for a starting point to dive into single-cell RNA-seq analysis.

This workshop assumes some familiarity with R.
We assume that you have attended WEHI’s Introduction to R workshops or otherwise consider yourself to be able to use R.

# What will you learn?

The goal of this workshop is to provide a solid foundation in the usage of Bioconductor tools for single-cell RNA-seq analysis by walking through various steps of typical workflows using example datasets.
Examples are taken from a range of commonly used single-cell RNA-seq technologies, such as the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Gene Expression and the CEL-Seq2 platforms, applied to a variety of human and mouse experimental systems.

Some of the topics we will cover include:

- Importing your dataset into R
- Quality control
- Normalization
- Dimensionality reduction
- Clustering
- Marker gene detection
- Cell type annotation
- Integrating datasets
- Differential expression

At each step in the workflow, we will pay special attention to data visualization, including interactive visualization, to help guide us in our analysis decisions and to interpret the results of our analysis.
